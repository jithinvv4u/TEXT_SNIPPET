(3) What is Data Ingestion?

Title: What is Data Ingestion?

Definition: The process of transferring data from various sources into a target data storage system (in this case, Databricks).

Key Steps:

Extraction: Retrieving data from its source.

Transformation: Cleaning, converting, and enriching the data.

Loading: Writing the transformed data into the target system.

Importance: Provides a foundation for analytics, machine learning, and data-driven decision-making. Good ingestion = good data quality.

(4) Why Data Ingestion Matters

(6) Data Sources and Formats

Title: Data Sources and Formats

Data Sources:

Relational Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle

NoSQL Databases: MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase

Cloud Storage: AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage

Streaming Platforms: Kafka, Kinesis, Event Hubs

APIs: REST APIs

Files: CSV, JSON, Parquet, Avro, XML

Data Formats:

Structured: Data organized in a predefined format (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet, databases).

Semi-structured: Data with some organization but not as rigid as structured data (e.g., JSON, XML).

Unstructured: Data without a predefined format (e.g., text files, images, videos).

(7) Data Ingestion Methods on Databricks

Title: Data Ingestion Methods on Databricks

Option 1: Using DataFrames API (Spark SQL):

Code examples for reading from different sources (CSV, JSON, Parquet, databases).

Explanation of DataFrame transformations (filtering, aggregation, joining).

spark.read.format("csv").load("path/to/file.csv")

Option 2: Using Databricks Utilities (dbutils):

dbutils.fs for interacting with Databricks File System (DBFS) and cloud storage.

Code examples for copying files, listing directories, etc.

dbutils.fs.cp("source", "destination", recurse=True)

Option 3: Using Spark Streaming:

Ingesting real-time data from streaming sources like Kafka.

Using spark.readStream to create a streaming DataFrame.

Example: reading from Kafka, performing transformations, and writing to Delta Lake.

Option 4: Databricks Auto Loader (Recommended for Cloud Storage):

Incremental data loading from cloud storage with schema inference and evolution.

spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles").option("cloudFiles.format", "csv").load("path/to/cloud/storage")

Benefits: Handles schema evolution, efficiently processes new files, and is cost-effective.

Option 5: Partner Integrations:

Fivetran, Stitch, Matillion, etc.

Pre-built connectors for various data sources.

Benefits: Simplified ingestion, reduced development effort.

(8) Code Examples (Simplified)

(CSV):

df = spark.read.csv("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/my_data.csv", header=True, inferSchema=True)
df.display()
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

(Parquet):

df = spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/FileStore/tables/my_data.parquet")
df.display()
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

(JDBC):

jdbcDF = spark.read.format("jdbc") \
    .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://host:port/database") \
    .option("dbtable", "schema.tablename") \
    .option("user", "username") \
    .option("password", "password") \
    .load()
jdbcDF.display()
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

(Auto Loader):

df = spark.readStream.format("cloudFiles") \
  .option("cloudFiles.format", "csv") \
  .option("header", "true") \
  .option("inferSchema", "true") \
  .load("s3://your-bucket/path/to/data/")

query = df.writeStream.format("delta") \
  .option("checkpointLocation", "/mnt/checkpoint") \
  .outputMode("append") \
  .start("/mnt/delta/your_delta_table")
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

(9) Delta Lake and Data Quality

Title: Delta Lake: Reliable Data Storage

What is Delta Lake: An open-source storage layer that brings ACID transactions to Apache Spark and big data workloads.

Key Features:

ACID Transactions: Ensures data consistency and reliability.

Schema Evolution: Supports changing the schema of your data over time.

Time Travel: Allows you to query previous versions of your data.

Data Versioning: Keeps track of changes to your data.

Unified Batch and Streaming: Handles both batch and streaming data in a consistent manner.

Data Quality Checks:

Constraints: Enforce data quality rules using Delta Lake constraints.

Data Validation: Implement data validation logic to ensure data meets certain criteria.

Monitoring: Monitor data quality metrics to identify and address issues.

Example using Delta Lake:

df.write.format("delta").mode("overwrite").save("/mnt/delta/your_delta_table")
delta_df = spark.read.format("delta").load("/mnt/delta/your_delta_table")
delta_df.display()
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python

(10) Automation and Orchestration
